# Physics-Lab
Contains the Lab and Project Reports conducted in the Advanced Physics Lab course at Cornell.

The two experiments conducted in the Advanced Lab course were the Muon Lifetime Experiment and the Transmission Line Nanosecond Pulses Experiment. The report for the Muon Lifetime Experiment is labelled "Muon_Lifetime_Eperiment.pdf" with accompanying code in the python file labelled "Muon Lifetime Attempt 4.py". The report for the Transmission Line Experiment is labelled "C11-Transmission_Line_Experiment.pdf". 

The project performed within the Advanced lab course was to create a 3D schematic of a chemical engineering process with the report labelled "Phys_4400_Project 2.pdf" and the 3D model labelled "Chemical Engineer Process (Complete).f3d".
